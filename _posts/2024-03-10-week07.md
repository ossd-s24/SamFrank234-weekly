## Open Source History

I think the origins of FOSS are very interesting; I love history, and I am
partial to the philosophy behind free and open software, so this week's lesson
was especially cool for me personally. However, I could not help but notice that
there was a lot of controversy surrounding a few of the founding figures (most
notably RMS and Linus Torvalds). The story about Stallman's printer is a great
origin myth for FOSS though.

## My Group's Project Progress 

My group has decided on [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) as our final
project. this was the project that I completed an evaluation for last week. It
seems like a really good service, one that I might actually start using, and it
aligns with some of my interests in security. However, part of me hoped that I
might be able to find either a large, well-known project to contribute to or a
small, somewhat niche, but cool project where we could make significant
contributions and potentially even become central figures in the community.
However, after a class of searching, we couldn't find any great options and
settled upong Bitwarden as something of a compromise. I am not too disappointed
though, because I know that my journey in Open Source is just beginning, and now
I have a list of projects to keep an eye on as my experience grows.
