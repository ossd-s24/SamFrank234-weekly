## Git

The git exercises were pretty fun. I already knew most of the basics, partly
because I am TAing for a CS class right now and have gotten lots of experience
helping students fix their git mistakes, and partly because I've already made a
lot of those mistakes myself. However, I still learned a lot, particularly about
merging, which I never really understood completely. I also learned more about
rebasing and fast forwarding, and was able to make some informed decisions about
my config settings, which was pretty exciting.

## Browser Extension

The Browser Extension group project has been a little more challenging than the
git exercises. We all brought very different ideas to the table, so figuring out
one to focus one has been a process of compromise. Additionally, our schedules
did not really permit any in person or even very much synchronous collaboration,
so we have had to figure out other ways to work together. I figure this is very
similar to real open source projects where people live all over the world and
have all sorts of different responsibilities. The good ting is our group has
gotten along very well from the start and we seem to share a common goal of
completing this assignment, so we have been able to overcome these challenges.
