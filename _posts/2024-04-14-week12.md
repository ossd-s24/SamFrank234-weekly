## Christopher Snider

I very much enjoyed Christopher Snider's talk. In some ways, it 
reinforced my perception of Tidepool from the videos we watched. 
Snider himself professed to not be very technical, and he focused mostly on
transparency and openness, rather than community contributions. However,
I may have underestimated the community factor previously. For instance, I learned
that most people working on Tidepool have diabetes, so the project is very
personal for them. The whole project was essentially formed by a community of
users. I also learned how Tidepool's openness facilitates inoovations by the community.
Even though it is rare that they get pull requests from people outside the 
organization, the approach of Tidepool enables enyone to fork their code and
fiddle with it, whereas previous closed loop systems did not permit this.  

## Working More on Our Project 

This was a bit of a busy week for me, so I did not get as much work done on the project.
However, after struggling with a lot of the code issues, we are shifting our focus
for the short term towards making fixes in the documentation, since these can still
lead to PRs (which get merged pretty quickly).
