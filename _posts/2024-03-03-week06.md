## Picking a Project 

Honestly, I am still a little unsure about what direction I want to go for the
final project. I feel that I want to make an impact and land on the success
stories slide for next semester, but none of the projects we have evaluated so
far have really stood out to me. I think it will be a little bit of luck and a
good measure of determination and perseverance that ultimately decides how
successful my experience is. I think it will be very easy to become discouraged
and check out mentally, or just do the minimum for the class, but I know if I
can overcome that, I should be able to do something I can be proud of. It should
be exciting
