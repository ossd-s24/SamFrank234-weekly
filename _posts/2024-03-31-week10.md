## Working More on Our Project 

Since my last post, we have made good progress. We have set up the
Bitwarden development environment ad signed their contributor's agreement.
We have also been browsing issues and one other group member was able to 
comment on an issue, help troubleshoot, and eventually get the issue closed
without any code fixes needed. Now, we are looking for something we can actually
work on, and it is a little tricky. There haven't been any good first issues
coming in recently, and it's a pretty large codebase. Right now, we are looking 
at a couple promising issues and just trying to diagnose where the problem is
actually stemming from. I think this might be harder than fixing the bug in the end.
There are also some easier-looking bugs on the mobile side that might help us get
more credibility in the community. They don't assign issues, but maybe we can still
claim one and work on it if they see we have contributed already. I worry that even
if we can open a PR, they might prefer to go with what one of their own engineers
wrote, especially if they already committed story points to working on it.
