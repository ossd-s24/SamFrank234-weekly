## Starting Work on Our Project 

This week we started working on our project. First we finalized
our decision on what open source project we actually want to work
on. We looked at a lot of different options. We checked out Mozilla
Firefox, which looked promising at first because of how big it is
and because of some mentorship programs they have, but it looked like
there wasn't a lot of activity and it seemed unlikely we would actually
get a PR merged. Then we checked out some smaller projects, but they
had the opposite issue: not enough issues to work on. Our final thought
was to research smaller open source projects, particularly ones local to 
NYC, adn I found some cool things through the NYPL, but they don't look
like they are particularly active anymore. So, eventually we settled on
Bitwarden, which is a bit of a middle ground in terms of size, and is very
active. The biggest challenge I foresee is that Bitwarden has its own
engineering team, so it might be difficult to get work accepted as an outsider,
newcomer, and a student.
