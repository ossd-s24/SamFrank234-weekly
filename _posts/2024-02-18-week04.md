## Browser Extension

I think our group worked pretty well together on the browser extension, although
we were quite bus individually so we didn't put as many features into the
project itself as some of the other teams. My main contributions to the codebase
were adding the logic to link to the Wikipedia pages of the quote authors, and
improving the README. I also played a big role in communication and pointing out
deadlines and requirements. Of the other projects, my favorite was probably the
[Study Tool](https://github.com/ossd-s24/studyTool), although when I tried it on
my own machine I got some unexpected behavior. I may try to figure out more
about the bug and create an issue once I figure it out (or at least know how to
reproduce it).
